# Goals

For this challenge, I created a simple to-do app with the following goals:

1. Alternating color backgrounds for each entry in the to-do list, based on the array index in state.
2. Have a delete button in the form of a trash can icon that only shows when the mouse is hovering over a to-do item.
3. Ability to add new to-dos either through pressing Enter or clicking on a + button.
4. Basic flexbox styling using vanilla CSS.
5. Time to complete ~2 hours.
